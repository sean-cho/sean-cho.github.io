My research interest lie in the integration of various [multi-omics](https://omics.org/index.php/Omes_and_Omics)
datasets and approaches to study the biology of disease and improve clinical
care.

Specifically, I am interested in:

1. Developing methods for integrative multi-omics analysis and visualization.
2. Utilizing these methods to study disease processes and develop personalized therapy, including biomarkers and targeted therapies.

Ideally, this research would be performed as part of an interdisciplinary team of experts,
including experimental biologists, biostatisticians, and physicians.

Currently, I am a post-doctoral fellow at Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, working with
[Dr. Jonathan Pevsner](http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/php/index.php).
My reseach focuses on identifying the role of [somatic mosaicism in behavioural and
developmental disorders](http://brainsomaticmosaicism.org/), with specific
focus in bipolar disorder, through the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Cellular and Molecular Medicine program](http://cmm.jhmi.edu/)
at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under the supervision of
Drs. Saraswati Sukumar, Christopher Umbricht, and Leslie Cope.

My dissertation focused on performing genomics studies from archival tissue
samples. I developed methods for RNA/DNA extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue. In collaboration with Illumina, Affymetrix, and core facilities in
several institutions, we performed microarray analysis and RNA-sequencing of these
samples to (1) study the biology of disease, and (2) identify prognostic biomarkers.
To maximize the amount of information from these samples, I developed the [Epicopy](https://github.com/sean-cho/Epicopy)
R package that allows users to extract copy number variation information from
raw methylation microarray data.

Prior to that, I had worked as a research associate with Dr. Michael Jensen at the
[City of Hope](https://www.cityofhope.org/homepage) on chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T-cell therapy for cancer.
